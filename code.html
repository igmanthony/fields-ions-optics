      <h1>The simulation code</h1>
      <h2>Learning by inspecting and tweaking</h2>
      <p>
        As mentioned in the <a href="index.html">forward</a>, my learning breakthrough was facilitated by observing and modifying the code that actually performed the simulations. The purpose of this site is to help facilitate that learning process — and there really isn’t any substitute for looking at and playing with code that performs the ion simulations. The <a href="https://github.com/igmanthony/fields-ions-optics">code for this site</a> is freely available. The code that powers the Simulation Playground is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> and contained in a single “lib.rs” file that can be found in the “Simulation Code” folder. The Rust code is compiled to  and then compiled to <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Webassembly</a>. Hosting is provided by <a href="https://github.com/igmanthony/fields-ions-optics">GitHub</a>. No cookies are used for this site, although Javascript must be enabled to use the Simulation Playground.

        This site all came about from a small script that I provided to my students. To download a .zip file containing this script (“ion_simulation_script.py”) as well as a “readme.pdf” and an “electrodes.png” files that are helpful for using the script, click the button below:
      </p>
      <div style="text-align:center;font-size:25px;"><a href="ion_simulation_script.zip"><button style="padding:15px;font-size:16px;font-weight:600;box-shadow: 0 2px 3px 0 #00000033, 0 2px 5px 0 #00000030;">Download .zip file</button></a></div>
      <p>
        I have also provided the <a href="python_simulation_readme.html">readme as a webpage</a>. This readme walks through setting up the Python toolchain, using the script, and a few modifications to a simple einzel lens simulation. It also provides a short introduction to the Python programming language and some conceptual questions.

        An unzipped version of the three zipped documents can also be found on the <a href="https://github.com/igmanthony/fields-ions-optics">GitHub</a> repository for this site under the “unzipped python script” folder.
